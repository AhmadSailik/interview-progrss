- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
A Z-score is describing the relationship of value to the mean of a group of values 
and deciding which is better than, depending on standard deviations. 
Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score 
is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.

subtract min value from actual value and divide it with max minus min, 
The range of scale in [0, 1] or [âˆ’1, 1]. the impact is that we end up 
with smaller standard deviations, which can decrease the effect of outliers. 
like when we have values that might be in thousands and a few might be in small ranges 
that help us to see the changes in the value of the dataset that represented by data

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library?
  what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. 
The goal is to help us to test our code by using unit testing 
which is automated tests written and run by software developers 
to make sure all of the programs is working 
and check if we have bugs during the execution of programming
